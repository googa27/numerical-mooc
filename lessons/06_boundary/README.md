# Boundaries take over: the boundary element method (BEM)

## Outline (tentative)
1. *Green's function*: weak and boundary integral formulations; 1D Laplace equation; Green's function.
2. *2D electrostatics with collocation*: electrostatics problem statement; BIE derivation; basis function; Collocation BEM matrix.
3. *2D electrostatics with Galerkin*: Galerkin BEM matrix; comparison with colloation.
4. *2D scattering*: use BEM for an acoustics problem.
5. test
