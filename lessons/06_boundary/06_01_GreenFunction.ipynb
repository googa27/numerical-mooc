      "# Boundary Element Method (BEM)\n",
      "\n",
      "The BEM is a numerical and computational method to solve linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as integral equations. This integral equation can be taken as an exact solution. The boundary element method attempts to use the given boundary conditions to fit boundary values into the integral equation. Then, the integral equation can be used again to calculate numerically the solution directly at any desired point in the interior of the solution domain. This method is applicable to problems for which Green's functions can be calculated.\n",
